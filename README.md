# Codecademy-Terminal-Game
  This is the first Codecademy portafolio project for the computer science course. This project is meant to be a terminal bullet hell game, where you need to shoot the asteroids that come your way and try to destroy you. I decided to challenge myself and make this game without the use of terminal game engines or any video aid (any youtube video that helps solve a problem in my code). This challenge was a fun way to test my skills and teach me what it is like to work for a company with little documentation. The game ended up becoming a multithreaded game, with self-implemented collisions and save-files.
  
  # Starting The Game
  
  To start the game open ``cmd`` and then ``cd`` to the directory where you have saved the program and type ``python3 main.py``. The game should automatically start!
